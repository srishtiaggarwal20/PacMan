# PacMan Game in Java üïπÔ∏è

## üéÆ Overview

Welcome to the classic **PacMan** game reimagined in Java! This project is a fun, graphical recreation of the iconic arcade game where PacMan roams through a maze, collecting food and avoiding ghosts. As you control PacMan, the challenge increases as you move around the maze and avoid running into the ghosts.

The game is built using **Java Swing** for GUI rendering and key listeners for controls. The walls, ghosts, and food are designed to bring the original PacMan experience to life!
